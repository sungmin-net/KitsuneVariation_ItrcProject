# Kitsune a lightweight online network intrusion detection system based on an ensemble of autoencoders (kitNET).
# For more information and citation, please see our NDSS'18 paper: Kitsune: An Ensemble of Autoencoders for Online Network Intrusion Detection

# This script demonstrates Kitsune's ability to incrementally learn, and detect anomalies in recorded a pcap of the Mirai Malware.
# The demo involves an m-by-n dataset with n=115 dimensions (features), and m=100,000 observations.
# Each observation is a snapshot of the network's state in terms of incremental damped statistics (see the NDSS paper for more details)

#The runtimes presented in the paper, are based on the C++ implimentation (roughly 100x faster than the python implimentation)
